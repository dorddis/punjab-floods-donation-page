## THE CRISIS SECTION

### Headline
Punjab's Worst Floods in Four Decades

### Crisis Stats Box (Red Alert Style)
⚠️ **The Devastation:**
- 1,700 villages submerged
- 500,000 people displaced from homes
- 15,000 acres of crops destroyed
- Families still in temporary shelters as winter approaches

### Supporting Copy
In August 2025, relentless monsoon rains and dam releases triggered catastrophic flooding across Punjab's border districts. Entire communities were cut off. Families climbed to rooftops. Children watched their homes wash away.

UNITED SIKHS deployed rescue boats within 24 hours, operating through the night to save lives. We've rescued over 2,000 people, served thousands of hot meals daily, and committed to rebuilding 11 villages from the ground up.

**But the work isn't finished.**

Winter is here. Families need permanent homes. Children need schools. Farmers need seeds. Your year-end gift makes this possible.

For over 25 years, we've provided disaster relief, legal aid, education, and community development across North America, Asia, Africa, Australia, and Europe. We hold an 84% rating on Charity Navigator. Our work is guided by the Sikh principle of seva (selfless service)—recognizing the human race as one.

### Q2: Is my donation tax-deductible?
**Yes!** UNITED SIKHS is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit in the United States (EIN: 11-3483921), making your donation fully tax-deductible.

### Q3: How will my donation be used?

Every dollar creates tangible impact: shelter, food security, and hope. We maintain full transparency with regular photo updates from the ground.

### Q4: Will I receive updates?
Yes! You'll receive photo updates via email showing reconstruction progress in Punjab's flood-affected communities. Follow our real-time work on social media and see the direct impact of your contribution.

### Q5: Why donate before Dec 31?
Two reasons: (1) Claim your tax deduction for 2024, and (2) Punjab's families urgently need permanent shelter as winter deepens. Your year-end gift accelerates reconstruction and helps us plan resources for continued recovery in 2025.

### Q6: What makes this different from other disaster relief?
UNITED SIKHS doesn't just provide emergency aid—we adopt communities for long-term rebuilding. Our 11 adopted villages in Punjab will receive comprehensive support: homes, schools, livelihood training, and agricultural restoration. We stay until communities are truly restored, not just surviving.
